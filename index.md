Since October 2020 I am collaborating with the  Human Inspired Technology Centre - HIT  of the University of Padova, within a project on "Digital twins di sistemi termodinamici e meccanici controllati" under the supervision of Prof. Fabio Marcuzzi.

I just submitted the final thesis of my Ph.D. of the Doctoral School in Computational Mathematics at the University of Padova, with a scholarship funded by Electrolux Italia: "High Performance Calculation for Model Based Design applied to home appliances design", with supervisor Prof. Fabio Marcuzzi. 

My main research interests are Numerical methods for Signals and Systems.
